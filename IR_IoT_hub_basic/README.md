# IR_basic_hub

This isn't intended to be a complete project. It was simply a stepping stone to the network-connected versions.

The main loop is a place for experimentation. It currently has code for reading incoming IR signals and also for sending a chosen code at regular intervals. But you're not meant to use both at the same time.
